The /lib directory contains the Java library all compiled programs contains
and is create a simple abstraction layer to the LEGO construction and the
language. A copy of the library is placed as a compressed zip file in
/src/codegen/lib.zip and is the file there is unpacked to every compiled
program.

The /src directory contains the compiler itself, The compiler takes
KittyCraneium code and compile it into Java code there can later be compiled
to a LEGO NXT device running [LeJOS NXJ](http://lejos.sourceforge.net/).
